# Efficient-RL project
This is the code for a project lead for an internship with the [Brain-Bzh](http://recherche.telecom-bretagne.eu/brain/) research team in IMT Atlantique.   
We aim to use recent advances in unsupervised and self-supervised  to make current Reinforcement Learning algorithms more efficient.  

The code was forked from RL Baselines3 Zoo, for which you can find the documentation for on the [original repo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo).
